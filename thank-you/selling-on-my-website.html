              <br />
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Now that you have decided what to sell online, the next step is
                to focus on figuring out where to sell. While there are a lot of
                options, only a few might be best suited for you depending on
                your needs. Each platform or option has its own advantages and
                disadvantages, so it pays to research into a few options before
                deciding which one to use to start selling online. <br /><br />

                The platforms can be broadly classified into three categories:
                self-designed store, marketplace, sell via dealer/distributor.
                Let’s briefly look into what each does.<br /><br />
              </p>
              <h4><b>Selling on Your Website</b></h4>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                These platforms empower you to run your own exclusive online
                store. Depending on the platform, different tools are provided
                to sellers to design and create their online store, list
                inventory, market to customers, collect payment and fulfill
                customer orders. Most Self-designed Store platforms charge a
                monthly subscription fee to host your online store, and a small
                commission in the range of 2%-3% to collect and process payments
                from customers. These platforms also connect the seller with the
                most optimal and cost-efficient logistics partner to fulfill
                customer orders anywhere in the world. <br /><br />

                While these platforms support with necessary technology tools to
                create online stores, list inventory, collect payment and
                fulfill customer orders, the responsibility to bring customers
                to the online store is primarily with the seller. Grow Business
                Inc.’s platform helps you with everything needed to run your
                online business successfully. <br /><br />

                We provide robust technology infrastructure and advanced tools
                that empowers you to create your own online store and list
                unlimited products in a few minutes, collect payment in any
                currency from customers across the globe, and leverage our
                logistics partners to ship customer orders anywhere in the
                world. If you’re interested in setting up your online store to
                further grow your business, please contact us

              </p>
              <h4><b>Marketplace</b></h4>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Marketplaces are the platforms which empower sellers to list
                their inventory and set up their online store on a website or
                app managed by a marketplace. As the name suggests, an online
                marketplace is a virtual market-like setup where different
                sellers and businesses can set up their virtual shops on a
                property (domain or website) owned and managed by another
                company. Buyers or consumers come to the marketplace because it
                offers a large selection of products that they may not find on
                individual online stores. Best examples of marketplaces are
                Amazon and eBay. <br /><br />
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                The pros of the marketplace are:<br />
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    <b>Less Work</b> - You don’t have to worry about creating
                    and building your own online store. You can leverage what
                    marketplace has already built to list your products. You
                    don’t have to worry about having the right technology
                    infrastructure to support the traffic and maintain a very
                    high (99.99%) uptime. And, you don’t have to worry about
                    bringing traffic to your product listing page. Marketplace
                    does all the heavy lifting to bring traffic to its website.
                    All you have to focus on is optimizing your product listing
                    page so that the traffic, once on the marketplace, can
                    easily find your products.

                  <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    <b>Low Commission to Collect Payment</b> - 0-to-low
                    commission charged to collect payment from customers across
                    the globe.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    <b>Outsource Storage and Fulfillment</b> - Depending on the
                    marketplace, you don’t have to worry about fulfilling the
                    customer order and/or storing your inventory. For example,
                    the Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) allows sellers to store
                    their inventory in an Amazon warehouse, and once the order
                    is placed then the product is shipped to the customer by
                    Amazon. On the other hand, eBay allows sellers to list their
                    inventory/product on eBay but the storage of inventory and
                    fulfillment of customer order has to be managed by the
                    seller.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    <b>Scaling Globally</b> - Depending on the marketplace, it’s
                    easy for you to geographically expand and sell your products
                    anywhere in the world. For example, Amazon allows sellers to
                    sell globally under the Global Selling program.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    <b>Low-ish Shipping Rates</b> - Marketplaces benefit from
                    economies of scale, and hence are able to negotiate
                    extremely economical shipping rates, which some, if not all,
                    marketplaces pass on to the sellers. As a result, the
                    sellers can offer extremely low shipping rates to buyers,
                    which the seller might not be able to do when selling on
                    their own online store.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                The cons of the marketplace are:<br />
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    <b>Tough to Differentiate Identity and Brand </b>- It’s
                    tough to have your unique identity and brand when selling on
                    marketplaces. Online marketplaces are extremely crowded as
                    you have to compete with thousand other sellers or
                    businesses offering similar products as yours. It’s tough to
                    be within the top 3 search results of any product, and one
                    has to optimize the product listings to be found as quickly
                    as possible by the potential buyers and customers. As a
                    seller on a marketplace, you’re one among thousands, if not
                    millions, and you’re on equal footing with every other
                    seller as every seller gets the same real estate to showcase
                    their products. Customers of the marketplace rarely come
                    there for any particular company. Instead, customers are
                    interested in getting the best product regardless of the
                    brand as quickly as possible.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    <b>Extremely High Commission</b> - Depending on the
                    marketplace, a high commission is charged per order or per
                    transaction whenever the sale happens. The commission
                    further increases when the marketplace offers storage and
                    fulfillment options. The commissions can run anywhere
                    between 5% to 30% per sale. This is the commission charged
                    when selling locally. When international transactions are
                    included then the commission can range anywhere between 10%
                    to 40% per sale. For a lot of sellers, high commissions are
                    a bitter pill to swallow as it eats into their
                    profitability.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    <b>No Customer Relationship </b>- Very difficult to manage
                    direct customer relationships, engage with the customers and
                    run loyalty programs for them. Marketplace owns the customer
                    relationship, and any communication that seller has with the
                    buyer. Due to privacy concerns and various policies of the
                    marketplaces, sellers rarely know who the buyer is, what he
                    or she likes and dislikes. Every transaction between the
                    seller and buyer is positioned as a one-time transaction.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    <b>No Freedom to Set Your Own Policies </b>- Can’t set a
                    refund policy as you desire. When you sell on marketplace,
                    you’re bound by the rules set by the marketplace, which also
                    includes when refund can be issued and how much refund can
                    be issued to the customers. Marketplaces, more likely,
                    benefit buyers. If a marketplace were to favor sellers when
                    it comes to refunds then the buyers would most likely stop
                    buying from that marketplace, and buyers would start
                    exploring other buyer-friendly marketplaces. The more buyers
                    the marketplace has, the more money the marketplace makes.

                  <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    <b>Can’t Get Your Money Faster </b>- When you sell on the
                    marketplace, you may not be able to instantly get your money
                    and realize your working capital. Many marketplaces have a
                    policy of settling, i.e. remitting money into seller’s
                    account, once a week to once every 15 days. Unlike selling
                    on your own online store where you can see money remitted to
                    your account once a day to once every two days.

                  <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    <b>No Freedom to Deliver Unique Experiences </b>- You can’t
                    create the kind of online experience you want to create for
                    your customers. When you sell on marketplaces, you’re bound
                    by the online experience and shopping experience delivered
                    by the marketplace. It's the same for every seller and hence
                    you cannot differentiate yourself.

                    <b>Scaling Globally </b>- Depending on the marketplaces,
                    when selling on a marketplace, you may not be able to scale
                    globally as fast as you want. Not every marketplace offers
                    global selling, and not every marketplace is in many
                    countries. Amazon and eBay are exceptions to this. If you
                    want to target customers across the globe then you’re better
                    off being on Amazon or eBay, or having your own online
                    store.

              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Rarely practiced in recent times, this is similar to selling on
                marketplaces in some ways. When selling via distributor/dealer,
                the seller sells the manufactured product to the
                distributor/dealer. Alternately, the seller sends the
                manufactured product to the distributor/dealer who then lists
                the inventory on their website. When a seller sends the
                manufactured product to the distributor/dealer, both can
                negotiate a revenue-share agreement and the list price of the
                product. The distributor/dealer may or may not list the seller
                name on the distributor/dealer website. Distributor/dealer does
                the heavy lifting of bringing traffic to the site, and making
                the sale happen. Once an order is placed, the distributor/dealer
                fulfills the customer order. For all purposes, the seller
                doesn’t interact with the buyer, it’s the distributor/dealer who
                manages the customer relationship. This is very similar to auto
                dealerships. <br /><br />

                Key factors to consider when looking for a platform to set up
                your online business:<br />
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    If it’s a platform that offers a self-designed store then
                    how many customers - just like you - the platform has? The
                    more customers, the stronger the confidence in the platform.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    If it’s a marketplace, how many customers or buyers does it
                    have? The more customers or buyers the marketplace has, the
                    more potential customers for your business.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    If it’s a marketplace, how many sellers - just like you -
                    does it have? The more sellers, particularly in your product
                    segment, the marketplace has, the more confidence in the
                    marketplace but also more competition you will have.
                    potential customers for your business. It’s a good practice
                    to assess the number of sellers selling products just like
                    yours with the number of potential buyers on the
                    marketplace.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    What are different costs the seller will incur to use the
                    platform? What are the different fees the seller has to pay?
                    What are variable costs and fixed costs of using the
                    platform?
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    If it’s a marketplace, is the platform best suited for the
                    type and category of products you’re selling? Imagine
                    selling toys on Etsy, or fresh produce on eBay?
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    How reliable is the platform? How good is its customer
                    service? How fast can they resolve customer issues? Will
                    this platform exist 10 years down the line? These are some
                    questions you must find answers to.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    If it’s a marketplace, how seller-friendly the platform is?
                    How flexible is it with a seller who has just started the
                    business? How flexible is the platform itself? Some
                    marketplaces offer no flexibility and some have strict
                    guidelines that simple deviation from those guidelines lead
                    to account suspension. This is not a problem when you’re
                    selling on your own self-designed store.

              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                When you sell on our platform, you don’t have to pay exorbitant
                prices that others charge. When you sell a lot of items, the
                unit economics simply doesn’t work out on marketplace platforms.
                As an entrepreneur and business owner, you should have the right
                to keep the maximum share of your sales. <br /><br />

                What’s more? You’ve full control over your customer experience
                and freedom to engage with customer post purchases that other
                platforms don’t allow you to have. It’s totally worth it to have
                your own website and store. <br /><br />

                Once you have chosen the platform you want to go with, you’re
                almost there in setting up your online store and creating your
                online business empire. <br /><br />

                There are a few factors you must keep in mind to ensure
                long-term success. <br />
              </p>
              <h5><b>Highly Optimized Product Listing</b></h5>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Customers or buyers spend a lot of time reading the product
                description and product details. It’s imperative that you
                clearly articulate the benefits that customers will get by
                buying your product, and the benefits the customers will miss by
                not buying your product. Inject some fun and creativity into
                your listings that connect emotionally with the buyer. It’s also
                important to have high quality product images and videos that
                show products from all angles, and that help buyers visualize
                what they’re going to get by owning such a product. It’s no
                surprise that millions of buyers decide to buy something simply
                based on photos and videos. Great photos and videos are the
                easiest way to set yourself apart. <br /><br />
              </p>

              <h5><b>Social Proof</b></h5>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Social proof, aka validation or reviews from other customers and
                buyers about your product, generates trust in buyers and gives
                them confidence that what you’re selling is an amazing quality
                product. Whenever possible, request your customers to leave
                reviews as this helps in convincing your future customers to buy
                your products. <br /><br />
              </p>
              <h5><b>Kick-ass Marketing Strategy</b></h5>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                You should have a plan for how to promote your business outside
                of your chosen platform so that you can attract more customers
                to your listings and make more sales. This should include
                organic marketing such as search engine optimization and content
                marketing, and paid marketing such as ads on various platforms
                such as Google, Facebook, Youtube, Pinterest etc.<br /><br />
              </p>
              <h5><b>Fastest Fulfillment</b></h5>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Customers expect to receive their products as quickly as
                possible, many times within the same day, and often the next
                day. In fact, it has been seen that customers end up purchasing
                more whenever same day or 1-day delivery is offered. The added
                convenience of getting products quickly, within a few hours of
                placing the order, influences the customers to shop more often
                from that online store compared to going to other stores.
                Regardless of what selling model you use, it’s imperative that
                you choose a platform that empowers you to deliver your products
                as quickly as possible to your customers. The only exception is
                when you lower prices so low that lower prices compensate for
                longer delivery times.<br /><br />
              </p>
              <h5><b>Delightful Customer Experience</b></h5>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                This goes without saying that the customer is the king and
                customers are your business’ lifeblood. Treat your customer as
                if it’s your only customer and that without them your business
                will perish. <br /><br /><br />
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                You’re now set to run your online business empire. Always
                remember that starting your own online business is exciting and
                provides you with the freedom to work for yourself full-time.
                Enjoy the experience and be grateful that you have the freedom
                to be your own boss and work for yourself, and not be stuck in
                an office working a job you don’t enjoy. When you enjoy your
                work and your passion becomes your work then you’re more likely
                to succeed. Embrace the fast changing world of selling online.
