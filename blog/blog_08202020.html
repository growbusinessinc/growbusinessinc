                No matter whether you’re just starting out or are a seasoned entrepreneur, 
                running your business in the offline world, selling online and launching an
                online business has never been this easy. Blame it on Covid-19 pandemic 
                or customers’ changing preferences, online presence and selling online 
                has become a necessity. <br /><br />

                The barriers to sell online and launch an online business are lowering 
                every minute. Companies like ours have made it extremely easy for any 
                seller to launch an online business within a span of a few minutes. 
                If you are already a seller or a business then all you need is an 
                internet connection and a mobile device to sell online and launch an
                online business. <br /><br />
                
                And, if you’re just starting out. And, you dream of quitting your 
                mundane and uninteresting job, while traveling all around the world,
                sipping mojitos on sandy beaches of Hawaii or skiing in Alps, 
                or even sitting in your pajamas while enjoying long and relaxing 
                siestas, then online business can be a fulfilling career, 
                a calling, and a great way to earn money. <br /><br />
                
                Or maybe you are a student who has found out a cool product 
                in niche space and now are looking to make a few extra bucks 
                on the side. Whatever your case be, online business is for you.
                Selling online, or eCommerce, offers unlimited
                opportunities for anyone with an internet connection. <br /><br />
              </p>
              
                <h4><b>Why sell online? </b></h4>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Before diving deep into how to sell online, let’s take a minute to 
                dive deep into why sell online and launch an online business. <br /><br />
                </p>
                
                <h5><b>Flexibility</b></h5>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Who doesn’t like to work when they want and where they want? 
                Work from home, work in a traditional office setting, work 
                from a beach, work on the road and make your own hours. 
                There’s flexibility and freedom. Countless entrepreneurs 
                have built successful online businesses and are earning 
                at least seven figures revenue while embracing this flexibility 
                and freedom. With the help of Grow Business Inc., you can 
                sit within the comforts of your home, in your pajamas, 
                and launch your online business empire without having 
                to move an inch. <br /><br />
                
                eCommerce also gives you the flexibility to either manufacture or 
                not manufacture the products you sell, either own and store the 
                inventory yourself or outsource it to others, either fulfil or 
                deliver customer orders yourself or outsource it to others, and 
                most importantly, either build your own online store and mobile 
                apps, or use our product to get the job done. <br /><br />
             
                Take the example of Kavita Sarees, an all women-staffed and a 
                woman-led small business from Hubli, India, selling clothing 
                apparel primarily targeting women. The owner of this small business 
                single handedly sold designer cotton sarees door-to-door in Hubli 
                for a couple of years. The growth was coming at a slower pace. 
                What she saw was many of her customers’ acquaintances from nearby 
                cities were inquiring about her sarees. The owner of Kavita Sarees 
                sensed that if people from nearby cities can like her sarees then 
                people from other far-off cities would also like her sarees. An 
                ambitious woman, and a woman of grit, she was keen to go beyond 
                the confines of Hubli. With our help, she launched her online business, 
                got customers from all of the southern states of India, and saw her 
                sales increase 10x. She now plans to partner with us to target the Indian 
                diaspora internationally. She was able to do all this within the comforts 
                of her living room in Hubli while choosing when she wants to work, and 
                when she wants to relax and spend time with her family. Kavita Sarees 
                found this flexibility and freedom because of her online business.<br /><br />
                </p>

                <h5><b>What Your Customer Wants </b></h5>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
It’s what your customers want. There’s no two ways about it. 
As an entrepreneur, you’re razor focused on delivering value 
to your customers, where they want and how they want. The 
eCommerce evolution and the internet in our hands in the 
last decade has disrupted how people shop. Everything is 
being discovered, searched and bought online, be it niche 
products such as Star Trek figurines to everyday grocery 
produce. With the majority of customers having smartphones, 
commerce over mobile has also seen an explosive growth. 
If your customers are spending more time online, either 
on their mobile device (smartphone or tablet) or laptop 
and computers, then you must go where your customers are. <br /><br />

For those of you that are data-informed, global eCommerce sales 
will total US$3.9 Trillion (yes, that’s 39 followed by 11 zeros). 
According to eMarketer, a leading market research firm, eCommerce 
will grow ~13% year-over-year.  <br/><br />
                </p>

                <img
                src="/images/eCommerce2018_2024_v1.png"
                alt="Image"
                class="img-fluid img-absolute"
              /> <br /><br /><br />

              <p style="text-align: justify;">
              Not to mention, eCommerce is convenient to your customers. Your customers can come to your website, or visit multiple websites where you sell your products, read the reviews given by other buyers, place an order, pay and get the product delivered to their home, all done sitting within the comforts of their living room, in their pajamas, just like you. Your customer does not even have to move an inch to place an order and get the product. <br/><br />
              </p>

              <h5><b> Low Barriers to Entry</b></h5>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
              This is a big one. Unlike setting up a traditional physical shop, where you have to invest a lot of money and wonder whether to buy or rent a store and worry about finances and mortgages, with eCommerce, all you need is an idea of what you’re selling, an inexpensive connecting to internet mobile device, and internet connection itself. The upfront cost is very low. <br/><br />

Unlike traditional offline business where you get very little room to validate your product before selling, online business and eCommerce offer you unlimited opportunities. Imagine, you want to sell niche products such as  bamboo soaps, and you’re not sure whether there is any market for it. In an online business, you can validate the demand for the product by listing it as available on your website, and monitoring how many attempt to buy it. Now imagine, you found out that there is very less demand for bamboo soaps, you decide not to sell bamboo soaps anymore and go in a different direction. <br/><br />

Now imagine, you test another product, say Japanese manga figurines. You list the product as available on your website, monitor how many attempt to buy, and find that you got thousands of inquiries. You just validated which product has more demand and which product can help you make money easily. And, all of this was done at minimal upfront cost. Let’s look at some costs incurred: website hosting cost, and minimal money spent to run ads on Google and Facebook, and you’ve found out which product works the best and which doesn’t. Such tests are not easy to pull off in a traditional offline business. <br/><br />

With an online business, one is not constrained by physical space or location. You could set up your online business in an area with extremely low cost of living, and yet serve your customers everywhere without any hiccups. As you get freedom to run your business from anywhere, your costs lower. <br/><br />
              </p>

<h5><b> Global Reach</b></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Should you choose not to, by default, you can target customers all across the globe. Because of internet and global connectivity, It’s easy for a customer in Dallas, TX in the United States to find and buy from a niche seller in Nagoya, Japan. Not constrained by the physical location of your store, which restricts who can easily visit your physical store and buy your products, your online store takes the form of a virtual store on your customers’ screen, and your customer can visit your ‘virtual’ store from any corner of this world. <br/><br />

Using our product, you can choose any of our logistics partners to fulfill your customer order anywhere in the world. <br/><br />
</p>

<h4><b> Are there any downsides to selling online? </b></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
That’s a lot of benefits of selling online. Let’s take another minute to evaluate a few downsides of selling online. Like everything in life, there’s always a good and bad with anything. It’s important that one is aware of all pros and cons to make an informed decision. <br/><br />
</p>

<h5><b>Not As Easy As It Looks</b></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
It takes time to build a customer base, it’s a lot of hard work and a lot of patience. It may take anywhere from a day to a couple of months to get your first order. Don’t go in with a very high expectation that you will make a thousand dollars or fifty thousand rupees on your first day. You have to spend a lot of time figuring out what to sell, who to sell, how much to charge, when to accept refunds, how to keep customers happy so that she keeps coming back, and how to influence your customers so that they bring more customers to you. If you have already sold online before, you know how difficult it is. If you’re just starting out then more than the skill, patience and curiosity to learn are your friends to help you sell online successfully. It’s not a get rich quick scheme. <br/><br />
</p>

<h5><b>Wear Multiple Hats</b></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Selling online comes with a steep learning curve. You end up wearing multiple hats, more so when you are a one-person or two-person online store. You are a customer support, you are a CEO, you are a marketer, you are a website designer, you are an operations and logistics person, and you are a finance person. Until you are big enough to hire staff to manage those functions, you end up doing all that. <br/><br />
</p>

<h5><b>Can’t Be Just a Side Business</b></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
When you set up an online business, you will get customers from across the globe. You will have to deal with customer support, customer inquiries, customer shipments and everything else that goes with delivering products to your customers. This requires you to invest a significant amount of time and effort that it ends up being an almost full-time job, if not a proper full-time job. No matter how much you wish it to be a side business, given you’re dealing with regular people and customers, it will push you to be more involved in the business. <br/><br />

Now that you have looked at pros and cons, you can see that if you put in some time and effort then you can successfully build your online business empire. <br/><br />
</p>

<h4><b> What to sell?</b></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  If you’re just starting out then the first question you need to answer is what to sell. If you already have an offline business then all you need is to validate that what you are selling offline can also be sold online.<br/><br />

Deciding on what to sell is the most important decision you will make when launching your online business. This decision will determine your customers, your business model, your profitability, and your probability of scaling and growing. There are over 7 billion people on earth, and every individual has unique needs. That itself gives you over a billion different product ideas. Of course, you can’t sell all of it, so it is important that you get it right what you plan to sell. <br/><br />

There are couple of things you need to factor when deciding what you want to sell:<br />
<ol>
<li><p style="text-align: justify;"> There must be strong customer demand for the product. If customers show little-to-no interest in your product then the business will never grow. It’s better to pick a product that is not seasonal, i.e. the product has demand and is bought consistently in all seasons. For example, if you sell Santa Claus caps then know that you will see most to all of your sales around Christmas, while the rest of the year could be pretty dull. </li></p>
<li><p style="text-align: justify;">Better to sell a product that’s bought recurring instead of a one-time buy. Recurring sales ensures recurring revenue and close relationships with the customer. For example, if you sell cast iron skillets then know that it lasts longer. There is no harm in selling cast iron skillets or similar long-lasting (or even premium) products, as long as margin per unit sold is high. </li></p>
<li><p style="text-align: justify;">Customers must be willing to buy your product online. Even if there is demand for the product but customers are unwilling to purchase online then online business can never succeed.</li></p>
<li><p style="text-align: justify;">Your product must be different and have unique selling value compared to your competition. There is nothing wrong in selling the exact same thing that your competition sells, however, if the competition is too intense and your product is no different from the competition then you could end up in a pricing war, which will eat away your profits and may push you towards losses.</li></p>
<li><p style="text-align: justify;">The product must be priced appropriately. If the price is too high that your customers find it difficult to afford then you will have very little demand, sales and profit. Likewise, if the price is too low then not only you may attract the wrong customer segment and cheapen the brand but also see your sales and profit being eaten away. </li></p>
<li><p style="text-align: justify;">Most importantly, whenever you sell the product, you should be able to make a profit. Every unit of the product must generate profit.  </li></p>
<li><p style="text-align: justify;">You should be able to package and ship the product conveniently, or have right logistics partners that can ship your product to your customer correctly. Imagine, you’re unable to ship a custom designed sofa-set or couch because either shipping costs are too high, or the fastest economical shipping option takes your customer 2 months to get the product. Typically products that can be delivered faster to customers receive more orders than those that don’t.</li></p>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
How to assess the customer demand and how to go about customer research is a separate topic in itself which we will cover in post. For now, keep in mind the above factors are a great start to decide what you wish to sell online. <br/><br />
</p>

<h4><b>What are different selling models? </b></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Once you’ve decided what to sell, you must answer what your selling model is going to be like. There are quite a few selling models you can explore, and each has its own pros and cons. <br /><br />
</p>

<h5><b>Manufacture on your own</b></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
If you’re a manufacturer, an engineer or a programmer, a carpenter, an artist, a t-shirt designer or a hobbyist - who can create things by self then you can make your own products and sell them online. The key thing with manufacturing or creating and selling your own products is that the responsibility to source right raw materials or suppliers, to process them, to create something out of it, to diligently assess its quality, to make it available on your online store is on your shoulders. This will take a lot of your time. Not to mention, the additional time you have to spend being a web designer, marketer, customer service or customer support, operations or logistics person and a finance person, once you have put your creation on your own online store. <br/><br />

The key advantage of manufacturing your own are:<br /><br />
<b>High-quality</b><br />
You can be sure of the high quality of your creation. This is better than outsourcing it to someone and always wondering about the quality of their output.  <br/><br />
<b>Limit Costs</b><br /> 
Since you are manufacturing yourself, depending on how you go about it, depending on how skilled you’re in negotiating prices of your raw materials and how optimal you’re in your manufacturing process, you can save costs. <br/><br />
<b>No Minimum Limits</b><br />
When you outsource manufacturing, or directly source from the manufacturers, wholesalers or distributors, you’re constrained to order a certain minimum number of units to get good rates. When you manufacture yourself, you’re not bound by any such constraints. You can manufacture and sell as many units as you want.<br/><br />
</p>

<h5><b>Source from manufacturer</b></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
Sourcing from a manufacturer can be difficult. You will have to spend considerable time identifying and vetting the manufacturer, evaluating the quality of their output, and their ability to meet your customer demand. In working with the manufacturer, just like manufacturing on your own, you get to private label a product, i.e. have your own brand. <br/><br />

The hardest part is sourcing the right manufacturer as there are millions of small-scale manufacturers. The most popular route taken by many entrepreneurs is to find manufacturing partners in China. Once you have successfully navigated the challenge of sourcing the right partner then the sky's the limit. You not only get your private label product and create your own brand but also capture the maximum margin on your products. Sourcing from the manufacturer cuts down all the middle-layer thus significantly reducing your cost, which you can then pass on to your customers in the form of lower prices.  <br/><br />

One drawback of sourcing from a manufacturer is upfront investment needed to order products in bulk to get great per unit pricing for your products. Otherwise, if you order a limited quantity of products then the manufacturer may charge premium pricing.<br/><br />

Once a manufacturer sends you the final product, it’s your responsibility to receive and store the products, list them on an online store, market and acquire customers, and ship or deliver to customers after an order is placed. As a seller, you can partner with various logistics partners, including us, to ship your products. Once you have received the products from the manufacturer, we can also manage your entire online selling experience end-to-end, right from listing online to marketing to collecting payment from customers to fulfilling your customer orders.   <br/><br />
</p>

<h5><b>Source from wholesaler</b></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Sourcing from a wholesaler is somewhat similar to sourcing from a manufacturer. In the traditional retail and/or offline business model, one used by small and large brick-and-mortar stores and online marketplaces, it’s very common to source from wholesalers. Establishing contact with wholesaler is a lot easier than establishing contact with a manufacturer. Once you know what to sell and have identified the most reliable wholesaler partner, you can negotiate the best price per unit for your products. Some wholesalers even allow you to private label your products. <br/><br />

Similar to sourcing from manufacturers, a drawback of sourcing from wholesalers is upfront investment needed to order products in bulk to get great per unit pricing for your products. Otherwise, if you order a limited quantity of products then the wholesalers may charge premium pricing. Sourcing from wholesalers has comparatively higher cost than sourcing from the manufacturers. <br/><br />

Once the wholesaler sends you the final product, it’s your responsibility to receive and store the products, list them on an online store, market and acquire customers, and ship or deliver to customers after an order is placed. Once you have received the products from the manufacturer, we can also manage your entire online selling experience end-to-end, right from listing online to marketing to collecting payment from customers to fulfilling your customer orders.  <br/><br />
</p>

<h5><b>Source from Distributors</b></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Sourcing from distributors is unique and is done quite less often. It’s very similar to sourcing from manufacturers and wholesalers but you don’t get to private label your products. Unlike sourcing from manufacturers and wholesalers, the initial upfront cost of sourcing from distributors is very low and there are no strict mandatory minimums. <br/><br />
</p>

<h5><b>Dropship</b></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Dropshipping is a well-known practice in the world of online selling. In dropshipping, as a seller, you outsource manufacturing, packaging and fulfillment to the dropshipper while you focus solely on driving sales on your online store. In dropshipping, you never have to worry about storage of your inventory or products, most of the heavy lifting is done by the dropshipper. And, because your dropshipper is doing most of the heavy lifting by managing manufacturing, storing, packaging and fulfillment, your margins as a seller will be less because your unit cost of selling will be comparatively higher. <br/><br />

There are different models of dropshipping but the most common one is where your customer purchases a product from your online store at your list price. You then place an order for that product with your supplier at the agreed upon wholesale price. Your supplier then packages and ships the product directly to your customer.<br/><br /><br/>
