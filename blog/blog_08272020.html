              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                In Part 1, we learnt the pros and cons of selling online, key
                factors to consider when deciding what to sell online, and what
                are different selling models. Just to recap, the different
                selling models are: manufacturing or creating products on your
                own, sourcing from manufacturers, sourcing from wholesalers,
                sourcing from distributors, and dropshipping. <br /><br />

                Now that you have decided what to sell online, and which selling
                model to choose, the next step is to focus on setting up your
                business, if you’re just starting out. Those who already have
                set up a business, you may choose to skip this section and move
                directly to section ‘Where to Sell?’<br /><br />
              </p>
              <h3><b>Set up Business</b></h3>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Once you know what you are selling, where you are selling and
                how you are selling, the next step is formalize this by setting
                up a business entity. If you’re not ready yet to form a legal
                business entity yet then no problem. You can keep testing and
                validating your business idea until you are sure to formally set
                it up. While validating your business idea, ensure that you as
                revenue starts trickling in, you would have to start paying
                taxes. <br /><br />

                When you’re ready to formally set up a business, there are a
                couple of regulatory and compliance requirements you need to
                take care off. Starting a business includes understanding and
                dealing with many issues such as legal, finance, intellectual
                property protection, liability protection, compliance with
                regulations, and more. Every country has different requirements
                for setting up a business, it’s a best practice to speak to an
                accountant (CPA, CA etc.) or a lawyer to get professional
                advice. <br /><br />
              </p>
              <h4><b>Choose the type of business you want to set up </b></h4>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                This is very dependent on the laws of the country. For example,
                in the United States, a business entity can be set up as Sole
                Proprietorship, Partnership, S corporation or S corp, C
                corporation or C corp, or as a Limited Liability Company (LLC).
                These days any type of business entity can be set up easily and
                quickly. Depending on the type of business entity chosen, you
                may or may not be protected from personal liability.
                <br /><br />

                Let’s learn a little bit about each of these business
                entities.<br /><br />
              </p>
              <h5><b>Sole Proprietorship</b></h5>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Sole proprietorships are intended for simple, one-owner
                businesses. For example, freelancers, consultants, food trucks,
                one-person eCommerce stores or online businesses, etc. Sole
                Proprietorships do not have shares or ownership units which
                means the only exit option is to sell the assets of the company.
                Sole proprietorships are by far the simplest type of entity to
                set up. There really is no structure. Sole proprietors with no
                employees do not even need to register with the Internal Revenue
                Service in the United States. They can simply use their Social
                Security Numbers as the business tax ID. There is generally no
                need to “incorporate” to deduct business expenses. By default, a
                legitimate business that starts without formally incorporating
                is a Sole Proprietorship, unless there is more than one owner,
                in which case it’s a Partnership, and is eligible to deduct its
                business expenses. When it comes to taxation, Sole Proprietor
                owes personal income tax on the entire profits of the business
                regardless of whether those profits have been withdrawn or not.
                <br /><br />
              </p>
              <h5><b>Partnership</b></h5>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Whenever a Sole Proprietorship has more than one owner then it’s
                a Partnership. Just like Sole Proprietorship, business entities
                that are Partnership are very easy to set up. Partnership
                business entity is used by early-stage businesses that have not
                yet achieved significant profitability. The arrangement can be
                especially attractive for small companies without employees,
                where the owners do most of the work. While Partnership is
                simple, they require a few key things for smooth running of
                Partnership as a business entity. It is important to have a
                partnership operating agreement that controls the operations and
                ownership of the company. In Partnerships, the business income
                does not need to be allocated proportionately to ownership. This
                flexibility can be helpful when there is a very silent partner
                who contributed most of the capital but is not expecting a
                similar share of the profits. Any such arrangement must be
                clearly laid out in a partnership agreement. When it comes to
                taxation, Partnership owes tax on the entire taxable income of
                the Partnership, and it’s generally subject to FICA taxes. In
                addition, the co-owners in the Partnership are subjected to
                personal income taxes.<br /><br />
              </p>
              <h5><b>S Corporation</b></h5>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                As companies grow and become profitable they tend to choose to
                become a S Corporation. S corporations are a very popular entity
                choice for small and mid-sized privately held companies. S
                corporations do not pay any income taxes. Instead, the
                corporation's income and losses are divided among and passed
                through to its shareholders. The shareholders must then report
                the income or loss on their own individual income tax returns.
                Unique characteristics of S Corporation are: <br />
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    You must generally be a US resident or citizen to own an
                    interest in an S corporation. That is a deal breaker for
                    companies seeking corporate or foreign investors (e.g.
                    startups seeking venture capital funding). Certain trusts
                    and estates are allowed as stockholders, but partnerships
                    and corporations may not own a stake in an S corporation.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    Profits and distributions must always be allocated according
                    to ownership.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    In some cases, an owner of an S corporation that has losses
                    may not be able to deduct that loss on their personal tax
                    return. The loss would be carried forward to a future year,
                    but most startups would appreciate the extra cash from a tax
                    refund today, not in some future year. A partnership or
                    proprietorship structure is generally more favorable to
                    claiming such losses.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    Only one class of stock is allowed. There can be voting and
                    non-voting shares but classes of preferred and common stock
                    are not allowed.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    There can be a maximum of 100 stockholders.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <br />
              <h5><b>C Corporation</b></h5>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                If you are thinking of C Corporation then you are a publicly
                traded entity or about to become one. You have grown really big.
                All large American publicly traded corporations are C
                corporations. It is the only entity form that works for them.
                Another group that utilizes the C corporation structure are
                high-growth startups seeking series funding because their target
                investors may be entities or foreign individuals, neither of
                which are allowed to invest in an S corporation. C corporations
                are unique in that the corporation pays its own income tax. When
                it comes to taxation, while there is double taxation, the entity
                itself pays low taxes on the company's profits. Shareholders of
                a C corporation generally must pay tax on the dividends they
                withdraw from the corporation. Essentially the C corporation
                pays tax on its income first, and the remaining money is
                distributed to the owners, who pay tax on it again. <br /><br />
              </p>
              <h5><b>Limited Liability Company (LLC)</b></h5>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                An LLC is not a corporation under state law; it is a legal form
                of a company that provides limited liability to its owners in
                many jurisdictions. LLCs are well known for the flexibility that
                they provide to business owners; depending on the situation, an
                LLC may elect to use corporate tax rules instead of being
                treated as a partnership. A limited liability company (LLC) is a
                hybrid legal entity having certain characteristics of both a
                corporation and a partnership or sole proprietorship (if there
                is only one owner). As a business entity, an LLC is often more
                flexible than a corporation and may be well-suited for companies
                with a single owner. The owner(s) of an LLC must choose one of
                the other four structures as their identity for tax purposes.
                Compared to Partnerships and Sole Proprietorships, the LLC
                structure helps shield the owner’s personal assets from a
                business lawsuit, and informs the world that the owner is not
                personally liable for claims. Compared to S Corp and C Corp, an
                LLC structure is generally simpler to administrate. For example,
                true corporations are often required to hold annual meetings and
                keep records of meeting minutes. An LLC taxed as a corporation
                is generally not subject to these regulations. Starting out as
                an LLC gives a company flexibility for a later entity change.
                For example, a common path is to form an LLC first, have it
                taxed as a partnership, then elect S corporation status after
                the company becomes profitable. <br /><br /><br />

                Moving to India, a business entity can be set up as One Person
                Company, Limited Liability Partnership (LLP), Private Limited
                Company, and Public Limited Company. These days any type of
                business entity can be set up easily and quickly. Depending on
                the type of business entity chosen, you may or may not be
                protected from personal liability.<br /><br />

                Let’s learn a little bit about each of these business
                entities.<br /><br />
              </p>
              <h5><b>One Person Company</b></h5>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                This is best suited when there is only one owner of the company.
                For example, freelancers, consultants, food trucks, one-person
                eCommerce stores or online businesses, etc. Similar to Sole
                Proprietorship in the US, One Person Company do not have shares
                or ownership units which means the only exit option is to sell
                the assets of the company, and are by far the simplest type of
                entity to set up. When it comes to taxation, there is a tax
                holiday for the first 3 years under Startup India, they receive
                higher benefits on depreciation, and no tax paid on dividend
                distribution, and when applicable, business taxes need to be
                filed. <br /><br />
              </p>
              <h5><b>Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)</b></h5>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                This is best suited for firms in Service-oriented businesses or
                businesses that have low investment needs. A separate legal
                entity, in an LLP the liabilities of partners are only limited
                only to their agreed contribution. When it comes to taxation,
                they get the benefit on depreciation and business taxes need to
                be filed. <br /><br />
              </p>
              <h5><b>Private Limited Company</b></h5>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                These are the businesses with significant revenue. Private
                Limited Company is regarded as a separate legal entity from its
                founders in the eyes of the law. It has shareholders and
                directors (company officers). Each individual is regarded as an
                employee of the company. When it comes to taxation, there is a
                tax holiday for the first 3 years under Startup India, they
                receive higher benefits on depreciation, and business taxes need
                to be filed. In addition, there are mandatory audit
                requirements. <br /><br />
              </p>
              <h5><b>Public Limited Company</b></h5>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                A public limited company in India is similar to C Corp in the
                United States. It’s publicly traded, is strictly regulated with
                mandatory audits, and is required to publish its true financial
                health to its shareholders periodically.<br /><br />
              </p>
              <h4><b>Choose the name of the business</b></h4>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Once you have decided what type of business entity you want, the
                next step is to choose an appropriate name for your business.
                This name is your brand. The name should reflect what you and
                your company stand for, and it should be something that you are
                comfortable broadcasting all over the world. It’s also important
                that the name of your business should be such that your
                potential customers should not find it offensive or
                embarrassing. The business name should also be easy to spell and
                easy to remember. Selecting the right name for your startup can
                have a significant impact on your business success. The wrong
                name could result in insurmountable legal and business hurdles.

              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Depending on the type of business entity, you will have to
                register and get a tax ID for your business. A Tax ID is a
                number you obtain from your state and/or local government that
                allows you to charge sales tax whenever a buyer in your state,
                county and/or city purchases an item from you, even if it’s an
                online purchase. This is also known as an Employer
                Identification Number (EIN) in the United States, or Company
                Registration Number (CIN) in India. It’s similar to a Social
                Security Number (SSN) of the United States or Personal Account
                Number (PAN), but for businesses. Banks will ask for your Tax ID
                number when you open a company bank account. <br /><br />

              <h4><b>Get Appropriate Licenses</b></h4>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                This is dependent on what you sell and how you decide to sell.
                Not every product sold requires licenses or go through tons of
                bureaucracy. Following are some of the licenses or permits you
                may have to get: <br />

              <h4><b>Set up Payment System</b></h4>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                When you launch your online store, you want to be ready to start
                accepting money. That means you need to offer a range of payment
                options for your customers. It’s common for online stores to
                cater for credit and debit cards, net banking, Apple Pay,
                Paypal, Venmo, UPI, PayTM, WeChat Pay etc. You don’t need to
                sign up individually with each payment option. There are many
                payment aggregators available in the market. Better, you can use
                our payment system, which gives you access to over 25+ different
                payment options. It’s very important to support as many payment
                options as possible. The more flexible you are, the more sales
                you will make.<br /><br />

              <h4><b>Set up a Accounting/Bookkeeping System</b></h4>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Once the revenue starts trickling in, an accounting/bookkeeping
                system is required to keep track of income, outflow, expenses,
                CAPEX, EBITDA, profit and loss statements, assets, debt etc.
                This helps you learn your business’ cash flow and identify ways
                to further optimize revenue and profit. <br /><br />

              <h4><b>Protect Your Intellectual Property</b></h4>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Often ignored by entrepreneurs, it’s important to protect your
                intellectual property so that you can maintain a high barrier to
                entry for other companies/entrepreneurs. If you don’t then it’s
                easy for any new entrant to copy you and drive you out. Couple
                of ways to protect the intellectual property: <br />

                matter described in the patent’s claims. The key factors
                determining whether one can get a patent are:<br />
                a. Only the concrete embodiment of an idea or product is
                patentable.<br />
                b. The invention must be new.<br />
                c. The invention must not have been patented or described in a
                printed publication before.<br />
                d. the invention must be useful<br /><br />

                can be anything - an algorithm, a method to manufacture
                something, customer lists, to even the chemical formula of
