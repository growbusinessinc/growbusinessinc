          </div>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Started by two engineers, we are a All-in-One eCommerce platform to
            help sellers gain financial prosperity in their lives. <br /><br />
            As a seller, who wanted to convert hobby into a business, earn money
            and put food on the table, I set out to sell online. I soon realized
            how tough it is. While the likes of Amazon, eBay, Flipkart are great
            marketplace platforms, I soon realized I am tackling problems on
            many fronts. <br />
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I was getting hammered by commissions, which ate away much of my
                revenue.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I did not have full control over customer experience and how I
                wanted to present my catalog and store.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I could not do anything for customer engagement, starting with
                loyalty programs to offering personalized coupons and discounts.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I could not set the return and refund rules the way I wanted as
                I was bound by restrictive policies of these marketplaces.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I was getting hosed by exorbitant commissions and terrible
                currency exchange rates when transacting with international
                customers.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I could not choose the shipping partners I wanted, with whom I
                negotiated great rates, and ended up incurring exorbitant
                shipping costs at times on these marketplaces.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            As I talked to other sellers, hardworking men and women just like
            me, I learnt that the above problems were not unique to me. All of
            them suffered from the same problems, and they didn’t know of any
            alternatives. Selling online is a great way to sell all over the
            world and as a seller, I feel I should have more freedom than I
            currently have. <br /><br />

            An engineer in me, sensed an opportunity and I set out to fix these
            problems not just for me but for every seller out there. I partnered
            with a great friend of mine, a more talented and humble person than
            I, and together we started our company. <br /><br />

            Through our All-in-One eCommerce platform, we provide robust
            technology infrastructure and advanced tools that empowers sellers
            to drag and drop, launch their own online store, list unlimited
            products, and start selling - all in a few seconds. In addition, we
            empower sellers to sell to customers across the globe, accept
            payments in multiple currencies and ship globally. We also offer
            multichannel selling, in case, you still want to sell on the likes
            of eBay, Amazon etc. More than these features, what we do really
            great is offering unlimited support to all our seller partners.
            <br /><br />

            If you want to partner, let us know. We will be thrilled to work
            with you, and help you grow your business. <br /><br />

            If you do not have a domain name then you are free to buy from any third-party provider from your store’s admin panel.

            <b>What is your refund policy?</b><br />
            We believe that if you do not like a product, you should get your money back. You are free to cancel your subscription at any time. We offer favorable refund policies. Whenever you initiate the cancellation, your subscription will effectively end on the last day of the month of your cancellation, and you will no longer be billed. <br /><br />

            For example: You are subscribed to Essential plan, starting from March 1, 2020. You decided to cancel the subscription on July 18, 2020 then your subscription will automatically expire on July 31, 2020, and you will not be billed anymore from August 1, 2020. We run the subscription till the end of the month for two reasons: <br /> 
            1) to give our seller partners enough time to move their content from our platform to another platform, should they desire, and <br />
            2) ensure continuity of service should a seller decide to reinstate their subscription within the same month. <br /><br />

            If you have cancelled your subscription then you are free to purchase a new subscription anytime by going into your store’s admin panel.

          <h4 style="text-align: center; color: black;"><b>Payments</b></h4>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <b>How do I accept payment from customers?</b><br />
            Our All-in-One eCommerce platform supports a large number of third-party payment gateways or third-party payment providers. While all third-party payment providers offer the ability to accept payments via credit card, debit card, online bank transfer, UPI etc. some may additionally offer Apple Pay, Alipay, Wechat Pay, Samsung Pay etc. <br /><br />

            In addition, we also offer our own payment solution that empowers you to accept multiple currencies from customers across the globe in multiple ways, such as credit card, debit card, online bank transfer, UPI, wallets, Apple Pay, Alipay etc. <br /><br />

            You are free to choose any payment provider - either a third-party payment provider or us - based on what best suits your needs. Once you have chosen the payment provider, you are all set to start accepting the payments from your customers. You can go to your online store’s checkout page to see how the payment experience appears to your customers. <br /><br />

            In order to have customer’s money deposited into your bank account, you have to provide your bank account details where you want your money from the customer's payment to be deposited. The payment provider verifies the bank account information to confirm the accuracy of the details. Once the payment provider has verified then you are all set to have customer’s payment deposited into your account. 
 <br /><br /><br />

            <b>In which currencies can I accept payment from customers? </b
            ><br />
            You can accept payments in many currencies depending on the payment provider you have chosen. Some third-party payment providers may allow you to accept only &dollar;, &euro;, and &#8377;, while others may allow you to accept all major currencies.<br /><br />

            Should you choose us as your payment provider, instead of any third-party payment provider, then you can accept payments in all major currencies. <br /><br />

            We currently do not support any cryptocurrencies. 
 <br /><br /><br />

            <b>When do I receive my money? </b><br />
            When the customer’s payment is deposited in your bank account is dependent on the payment provider you have chosen. Some third-party payment providers deposit customer’s payment into your account either once or twice a month. <br /><br />

            Should you choose us as your payment provider, instead of any third-party payment provider, then you can have customer’s payment deposited into your bank account once a week. As sellers ourselves, we understand how important working capital is, and hence we do everything to get customer’s money to you faster. It takes us approximately once a week as there are many intermediary players involved between customer’s credit/debit card and your bank account. We are continuously working with our banking and payment partners to further reduce the time taken between the customer making a purchase and you, a seller, receiving the money.
 <br /><br /><br />

            <b>How do I handle customer refunds? </b><br />
            Handling customer refunds is very easy. First, you have set your refund rules for your online store. Once you receive a refund request from the customer, you can either approve or reject the request. To approve the refund request, you will choose the ‘Refund’ option from the Order Status drop-down, and click on ‘Confirm’ on seeing the message that ‘You confirm to refund the order, and agree that this change is irreversible and the amount associated with this order will be returned to the customer’. Your Order Status will be permanently updated as Refunded, and you will be unable to change the status of order thereafter. <br /><br />

            Once you have approved and confirmed the refund request, your customer will receive the money back on their original payment method within 15 business days. How soon the customer receives the money back depends on their payment method and their bank. <br /><br />

            Refunds will be treated as a transaction, and you will be charged a small commission, which is dependent on your chosen payment provider and your customer’s original payment method.

            <b>Shipping & Fulfillment</b>
          </h4>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <b>Can I ship or fulfill customer orders myself?</b><br />
            Yes. You are free to ship or fulfill customer orders yourself. There are no restrictions on your online store. If you are selling on multiple channels, such as Amazon, eBay or Facebook, then you are bound by the shipping options or fulfillment methods provided by those channels. <br /><br /><br />

            <b>Can I get help in shipping? </b><br />
            Our All-in-One eCommerce platform will help you in shipping your customer orders by calculating shipping rates to customer’s address, printing shipping labels, and offering discounted shipping rates through our shipping partners (available only to customers/sellers who have purchased a Pro plan). If you are selling on multiple channels, such as Amazon, eBay or Facebook, then you can leverage tools and services offered by those channels.  <br /><br /><br />

            <b>Can I ship internationally? </b><br />
            Yes. You can ship internationally anywhere on your online store. There are no restrictions on your online store. If you are selling on multiple channels, such as Amazon, eBay or Facebook, then you are bound by the shipping limitations of those channels. <br /><br /><br />

            <b>Do you have a warehouse to store my products? </b><br />
            No. We currently do not offer warehouse services to store your products or inventory. We are continuously exploring new offerings and opportunities to serve our seller partners, and should we offer warehouse services then we will let all our existing and new seller partners know.  <br /><br /><br />

            <b>Can you help me find a warehouse to store my products? </b><br />
            We currently do not offer a warehouse to store your products or inventory. However, through our All-in-One eCommerce platform, you can start selling on Amazon and leverage Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) to store your inventory in Amazon warehouses. <br /><br />

            We are continuously exploring new offerings and opportunities to serve our seller partners, and should we offer a service to connect sellers with third-party warehouses or start our own warehouses then we will let all our seller partners know.
